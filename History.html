	<h1>History of Special Effects</h1>
		<p>Before CGI, film makers had to be creative in order to create the world
	they wanted to have in their movies. As said before, the techniques film makers use/d are props,
	stop motion, paintings, puppets, and make-up.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Drawing Animation
		<p>Using the single-frame method (single images projected at a high volume of frames per second), 
		comic illustrations overlap each other to create moving images.</p></li>
		<li>Miniatures
		<p>Detailed miniature models of full-scale cityscapes were used alongside perspective techniques
		to create otherwise nonexistent environments.</p></li>
	</ol>

	<ol>
		<Li>Paintings
		<p>Matte paintings were actual projections or paintings placed behind 
		foreground objects to trick audiences into believing the actors were in a different location.
		</p></li>
		<Li>Stop Motion
		<p>Realistic puppets or models that are manipulated and photographed one frame at a time.
		</p></li>
		<li>Doubling
		<p>Using split-screen technology, the actor is in the same scene twice, were filmmakers locked the camera in 
		position and shot the scene a second time, laying half of each shot onto a single negative to create a composite.
		</p></li>
		<Li>Makeup
		<p>Actors wear prosthetics that change their facial/body features to create another character. 
		</p></li>
