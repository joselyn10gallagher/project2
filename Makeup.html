	<h1>My Special Effects Makeup</h1>
		<p>Ever since I was little, I love monsters and scary things. I started watching black and 
	white movies such as Creature from the Black Lagoon, to gory movies such as Saw. I would also 
	watch makeup videos on Youtube. One day I found a video on how to look like a zombie, and everything 
	changed after that. I got the supplies I needed in 2013, and since then I have been doing special 
	effects makeup. My dream is to work in the film industry by being a sfx makeup artist, along with others 
	jobs like becoming a director. I plan on going to EI School of Professional Makeup either during 
	the evening in my senior year, or during the one year break before college.</p>
