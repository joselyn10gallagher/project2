	<h1>Benefits of Special Effects</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Practical Special Effects creates a sense of realism on set. The actors can feel like they live in
		the movie's imaginary world, and can enhance their acting. Also, worlds such as Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, 
		Jurassic Park, and Star Wars makes the audience wish that they were apart of those movies.</li>
		<br></br>
		<li>SFX encourages creativity. There's a lot of techniques involved in creating scenes which makes the idea
		of movie-making special. Jaws, for example, the shark Bruce did not work for months and kept sinking to the
		bottom of the ocean. Finally, one of the sharks worked. Jaws took almost nine million dollars in the making.
		However, the movie ended up earning about 470 million dollars.</li>

		<ul>
			<li>Technology is always changing. After a couple years, CGI in films 
		do not look as realistic as it did when the movie first came out. Look at Toy Story and Shrek
		for example. The animation has less detail and less realism than the last movie from both series.
		Too much CGI also takes away the realism that was describe on the left.</li>
